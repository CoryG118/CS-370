Python AI

In this project I was given the GameExperience.py, Treasure Maze and most of the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb file. I implemented the Q-Learning in the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. This allowed the agent to learn the maze and find the fastest route to the goal.

Computer scientists solve problems using logic, code, and system design. That can mean building a simple backend service or working on large-scale AI systems. Our work matters because it powers the tools people rely on every day—apps, websites, networks, even infrastructure. We make systems more efficient, accessible, and secure. At the end of the day, we’re not just writing code—we’re building solutions that impact lives.

I start by breaking the problem down. What’s the goal? What are the inputs, outputs, and constraints? From there, I design a logical path to the solution—often sketching out pseudocode or flow diagrams first. Once I understand the plan, I build, test, and iterate. If something fails, I debug it one step at a time. I approach problems with patience and curiosity, knowing there’s always a solution if I ask the right questions and stay persistent.

I’m responsible for building software that’s secure, private, and accessible. If something introduces risk—whether it’s unvalidated input, data exposure, or biased algorithms—I speak up. For users, I aim to build systems that don’t harm or mislead. For the organization, I protect systems, data, and trust. Ethics isn’t an afterthought—it’s part of being a responsible engineer. If I’m not considering the impact of what I build, I’m not doing my job.
